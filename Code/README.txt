All the input images must be placed into the 'input' folder identified by a unique sequencial number. The folder with the real fingers must be named '1'.

In order to use this code, you must have your samples at Code/input.

To generate all the texture descriptors, run the script 'generateTextureDescriptors.m'
To train all neural networks, run the script 'trainAllNNs.m'
To obtain the metrics reported at the paper, run the script 'generateAllMetrics.m'

Run 'main.m' if you want to run the entire system. Note that it may take a few hours.
